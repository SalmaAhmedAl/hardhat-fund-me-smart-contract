# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a verify for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
yarn hardhat help
yarn hardhat run scripts/01-deploy-fund-me.js --network hardhat
yarn hardhat deploy --tags mocks
yarn hardhat node
yarn hardhat deploy
yarn hardhat deploy --network sepolia
```
